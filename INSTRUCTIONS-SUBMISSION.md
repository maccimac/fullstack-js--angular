Ways to Submit Your Project
You are welcome to build and submit your project via the Project Workspace in the classroom.

Or, if you choose to build the project locally, you can submit the project as a zipped folder or a public GitHub repo.

README
However you choose to submit your project, you must include a README. Your README must contain:

A brief description of your application, including key features and functionalities
Instruction to start the project, including any scripts or dependencies the user should know
Rubric
When the reviewer starts your application, they must be able to view a list of products, add them to a shopping cart, adjust quantities, and complete the checkout process by submitting a form, bringing them to an order confirmation page.

Before submitting your project, please review the Project Rubric to confirm that you have met all specifications.
